```Your task is to create a real-time webchat application. The following technologies must be used in the development process:

- Next.js for frontend and server-side rendering.
- tRPC for efficient, strongly typed API calls is a bonus.

Please follow the best practices and emphasize code quality, efficiency, and user experience.

**Notes**:
